# EINS

## Introduction

This repository contains a solution for a decentralized privacy preserving contact tracing system. 

### Goal

Its goal is to simplify and accelerate the process of identifying people who have been in contact with an infected person, thus providing a technological foundation to help slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The system aims to minimise privacy and security risks for individuals and communities and guarantee data privacy

### Privacy by Design

Privacy by design requires that user privacy is taken into account throughout the whole engineering process.
Decentralised data storage enables EINS users to store their geolocation data on their own devices, for both improved privacy as well as security. 

### Self Sovereign Identity

The principle of self sovereign identity aims to put the ownership of a user's online identity back in their own hands. This can be done in many ways, and consists of many sub approaches, more recently the introduction of decentralized ledger technology to provide trustless verification of identities (including pseudonyms identities) and fully secure data encryption and ownership.
